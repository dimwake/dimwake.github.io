<p>She showed up at his door, uninvited.</p>
<p>No umbrella. Shirt soaked to her chest. No bra.
Eyes sharp. Lips parted. Her thighs pressed together like she was trying to hold herself in.</p>
<p>He opened the door.
Looked her up and down.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask,” she said.
Then stepped in.
Dripping.
Needy.
Already half undone.</p>
<p>He shut the door with one hand, grabbed her face with the other.
“No small talk?” he said, voice low.</p>
<p>“You’ve already heard all my words,” she said, breath hitching.
“Take the rest.”</p>
<p>He kissed her like he hated her for coming back.
Teeth. Tongue. No space.
His hands tore her shirt up to her ribs.
No bra. Just cold, hard nipples begging for friction.</p>
<p>“You walked in wet and ready?” he muttered into her neck.
“I walked in aching.”</p>
<p>He shoved her against the wall.
Unzipped her jeans with one swift pull.
“No panties,” he growled.
“Didn’t deserve any,” she gasped.</p>
<p>His fingers dipped between her legs, soaked already.
“You’ve been dripping since I opened the door.”
“I was dripping before I knocked,” she whispered, eyes rolling back.</p>
<p>He slid two fingers in. Then three.
She cried out.
“Fuck—don’t stop, don’t stop, don’t—”</p>
<p>He pulled them out, shoved them into her mouth.
“Taste what you’ve been begging for.”</p>
<p>She sucked. Obedient.
Then dropped to her knees.</p>
<p>“Let me have it,” she said, voice hoarse.</p>
<p>She wrapped her lips around his cock — slow, deliberate.
No teasing — just need.
Gagging herself, taking him deep, spit running down her chin.</p>
<p>“Throat me,” he said.
She did —
And moaned around his length, one hand between her legs, touching herself while choking on his cock.</p>
<p>He pulled out with a pop.
“You’re a fucking mess.”
“I want to be worse.”</p>
<p>He lifted her — like nothing —
Carried her into the kitchen.
Set her down on the cold wooden table.</p>
<p>“Legs open.”
She spread, pussy glistening under the overhead light.</p>
<p>He slapped her inner thigh.
“You gonna cum again already?”
“I never stopped,” she whispered, breathless. “I came in the hallway.”</p>
<p>He leaned down.
Licked up her slit, slow.
Then bit her clit — just enough to make her jolt.</p>
<p>“Fuuuck—!”
Her hands gripped the edge of the table.</p>
<p>He stood up, rubbing the head of his cock along her folds.</p>
<p>“Say it,” he growled.
“Say what you want.”</p>
<p>“Fuck me,” she moaned. “Split me open. Use me.”</p>
<p>He pushed in.
All at once.
Deep.
Hard.
She screamed — a sound somewhere between pain and orgasm.</p>
<p>The table creaked.
His hands on her hips, slamming into her.</p>
<p>“Take it,” he hissed.
“Take every inch, greedy little cunt.”</p>
<p>“Harder,” she begged.
He laughed — and obeyed.</p>
<p>“Fucking god—yes, yes—deeper,” she choked out.
He shoved her shirt in her mouth.</p>
<p>“Bite it. You’re too loud.”</p>
<p>She came again. Writhing. Hips twitching. Pussy clenching around him.
But he didn’t stop.
Just kept fucking her like he was trying to fuck the memory of her out of himself.</p>
<p>They staggered to the bedroom.
She was bare now. Covered in sweat and cum.
He bent her over the dresser.</p>
<p>“Look.”
She raised her eyes.
Red lips. Ruined hair. Mascara tears.
She was beautiful in her undoing.</p>
<p>“You like what you see?”
“I look like I’ve been destroyed.”
“You’re not done yet.”</p>
<p>He pushed back in.
Bent over her.
One hand around her throat, the other rubbing her clit.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna cum again,” she whimpered.
“No,” he growled. “You’ll wait.”</p>
<p>“Please—please—I can’t hold it—”</p>
<p>He wrapped her hair around his fist.
“Take it. Cum on my cock. Look yourself in the eye when you do.”</p>
<p>She came hard — full body shake.
Crying.
Mouth open.
Eyes locked to her own reflection.</p>
<p>“Fucking ruin me,” she sobbed.
He was already doing it.</p>
<p>He dropped her down onto the carpet.
Ripped open a condom with his teeth.
Slid it on with shaking hands.
Got on top.</p>
<p>“Again?” she asked, delirious.
“You think I’m done with you?”</p>
<p>He kissed her now — finally.
Deep. Raw.
He slid back inside.</p>
<p>This time was different.
Not fast.
Not angry.
Just heavy. Deep. Thick with everything unsaid.</p>
<p>Her legs wrapped around him.
“I hate that I still want you,” she whispered.
“You don’t,” he said.
“You need me.”</p>
<p>Their bodies collided.
Wet. Sloppy. Loud.
She cried out with every thrust.</p>
<p>“Fuck—fuck—please—don’t stop—don’t stop—don’t stop—”
“Shut up and take it.”</p>
<p>He pounded into her.
Their sweat mixed.
The room filled with sound — flesh, breath, begging.</p>
<p>She came again, nails dragging down his back.
He pulled out just in time.
Ripped the condom off and came on her stomach, gasping.</p>
<p>They lay there.
Covered in cum, spit, sweat, memory.
Neither moved.</p>
<p>She whispered:
“What now?”</p>
<p>He said:
“You’re not sleeping here.”</p>
<p>She smiled:
“Then fuck me one more time before I go.”</p>
